         <p>The role of ferrous metals in general and of steels especially in the Australia economy is enormous. The economic power of a country can be determined by its out put or consumption of steel, since progress in the principal economic branches, be it construction, mining, transport, manufacturing engineering or agriculture, is unthinkable without steel. Though the output of non-ferrous metals, especially of aluminium has risen many times during the last 60-1000 years, the share of ferrous metals in world output prevails at the level of 95% of the total production of metals. In 2008, the world output of steel approached the figure of approximately 1.2 billion tones annually.</p>
         <p>Steel has to be properly selected, designed, cut, bent, lapped or welded, fixed and tied so that it gives the desired high performance. The selection of correct specification and quality of steel and its procurement from a reliable source is very important. The average user is relatively ignorant and less knowledgeable about the importance of specifications and quality of steel as related to intended application. Therefore, there is increasing need in certain economic branches such as the construction industry to introduce adequate awareness about total steel making process with its history to ensure quality of steel used.</p>

       <p>Steels are deformable alloys of iron with carbon and other elements. The manufacture of iron in its pure form is a labour consuming and expensive process and it is employed only for special purposes. Furthermore, compared to pure iron, steels have substantially greater mechanical properties, in particular strength. Steels are widely used in industrial and domestic applications. As a rule, the composition of steel includes carbon, manganese, silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus. To make steels with special properties, the metal is alloyed with other additions, such as chromium, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, niobium, vanadium, etc., along with higher quantities of manganese and silicon.</p>
       <p>Depending on the content of carbon, all iron alloys are divided into steels and pig irons. If carbon content is less than 1.7 - 2.0%, iron alloys are called ‘steels’; with higher carbon concentrations, they are called pig irons.  When carbon content is from 1.7% to 2.8-3.0% they are called steely pig irons and common pig irons when they contain more carbon. In modern iron and steel making, steels, as a rule, contain not more than 1.2% carbon and pig irons, from 3.5% to 4.5% carbon.</p>

        <p>Steel has a high ductility at high temperatures and can be readily forged or rolled on heating. Pig irons do not have such valuable properties. On the other hand, they have a substantially lower melting point than steels and have better casting properties, which are widely used in foundry practice
